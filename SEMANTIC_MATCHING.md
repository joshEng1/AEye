# AEye Semantic Matching - How It Works

## 🧠 **AI-Powered Question Understanding (Fast & Offline!)**

Your AEye assistant now understands questions even when phrased differently!

### **Before (Rule-Based Only):**
```
✅ "how many people?" → Works
❌ "tell me the number of humans" → Might not work
❌ "can you count the people for me" → Might not work
```

### **After (With Semantic Matching):**
```
✅ "how many people?" → QueryCount
✅ "tell me the number of humans" → QueryCount (matched!)
✅ "can you count the people for me" → QueryCount (matched!)
✅ "persons count please" → QueryCount (matched!)
```

## 🚀 **Performance**

- **Model Loading**: ~2-3 seconds (once at startup)
- **Query Matching**: ~5-10ms per question
- **Model Size**: 80MB (small!)
- **Runs**: Completely offline, no API needed
- **Total Latency**: Still < 20ms end-to-end

## 📝 **Supported Question Variations**

### Counting Questions
- "how many people", "count the people", "number of people"
- "how many humans", "tell me how many", "people count"
- "count people", "how many do you see"

### Presence Questions
- "is there a person", "is anyone there", "do you see anyone"
- "can you see anyone", "are there people", "anyone here"
- "person present"

### Location Questions
- "where is the person", "location of person", "find the person"
- "person location", "where's the person", "show me where"
- "position of person", "which side is the person"

### Scene Description
- "describe the scene", "what do you see", "tell me what's there"
- "what's in front of me", "what's around me", "scene description"
- "tell me about the scene", "what objects are there"

## 🔧 **How It Works**

1. **Sentence Embeddings**: Converts text to 384-dimensional vectors
2. **Similarity Matching**: Finds closest pre-computed pattern
3. **Threshold**: Requires 60% similarity (0.6) to match
4. **Fallback**: If no good match, uses original rule-based parser

## 📊 **Example Similarity Scores**

```
Query: "can you count the people"
  → Matched: "count the people" 
  → Score: 0.911 (91% similar!) ✅

Query: "tell me the number of people"
  → Matched: "number of people"
  → Score: 0.861 (86% similar!) ✅

Query: "do you see any person"
  → Matched: "do you see a person"
  → Score: 0.900 (90% similar!) ✅
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**

1. **More Natural**: Speak however feels natural
2. **Forgiving**: Understands variations and synonyms
3. **Fast**: Still responds in < 20ms
4. **Offline**: No internet or API needed
5. **Private**: All processing happens locally

## 🆚 **vs. ChatGPT/Gemini API**

| Feature | Semantic Matching | ChatGPT API |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Speed | ~5-10ms | ~1000-2000ms |
| Offline | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Cost | ✅ Free | ❌ $0.03/query |
| Privacy | ✅ Local | ❌ Cloud |
| Understanding | ⭐⭐⭐ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |

**For accessibility: Speed > Perfect understanding**

## 🔨 **Adding More Patterns**

Edit `nlp_enhanced.py` to add more question patterns:

```python
QUESTION_PATTERNS = {
    "QueryCount": [
        "how many people",
        "tell me the count",  # Add your variations here!
        "give me the number",
        # ...
    ]
}
```

Then restart the assistant - patterns are pre-computed at startup!

## 🧪 **Testing**

Test semantic matching:
```powershell
.\.venv311\Scripts\python.exe nlp_enhanced.py
```

This shows how well different phrasings match your patterns.

## ✅ **It's Already Active!**

The semantic matching is now automatically enabled in your assistant.
Just run normally and ask questions however you want! 🎉
