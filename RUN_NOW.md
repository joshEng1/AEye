# 🎉 Fixed! Run Your Assistant Now

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The semantic matching was finding the right intent, but then the code was re-parsing the question and getting confused.

**Before:**
- "how many humans" → "1 object" ❌
- "describe what you see you Google" → "I see person: 14" ❌

**Now:**
- "how many humans" → "2 people" ✅
- "what do you see" → "I see 2 people, 1 chair" ✅

## 🚀 Run Command

```powershell
# Make sure you're in venv (should already be activated)
.\.venv311\Scripts\python.exe assist_loop_hardened.py --source yolo --stt mic --mic-index 1 --model yolov8s.pt --confidence 0.45
```

## 💬 Try These Questions

All of these now work correctly:

**Counting:**
- "how many people?"
- "how many humans?"
- "count the people"
- "tell me the number of humans"

**Location:**
- "where is the person?"
- "find the person for me"
- "person's location?"

**Description:**
- "describe what you see"
- "what do you see?"
- "tell me what's there"

**Presence:**
- "is there anyone?"
- "do you see any person?"

## 🔧 The Fix

Modified `nlp_enhanced.py` to:
1. ✅ Execute commands directly instead of re-parsing
2. ✅ Detect when "humans" means "person"
3. ✅ Override "what do you see" → DescribeScene
4. ✅ Handle all intents properly with TemporalBuffer
